## Student Placement Prediction using Logistic Regression 

This project implements logistic regression to predict the chance of placement for students based on their IQ scores and CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average). The dataset used for training the model includes features such as IQ and CGPA, with a binary outcome indicating placement success (1) or failure (0).

### Key Features:
- **Logistic Regression Model:** Trained using scikit-learn to classify students into placement categories.
- **Dataset:** Contains information on students' IQ, CGPA, and placement status.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Model performance assessed using metrics like accuracy.

### Files Included:
- **main.ipynb:** Jupyter Notebook containing data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **data.csv:** Dataset used for training and testing the model.
- **requirements.txt:** List of Python dependencies for reproducibility.

### Usage:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/pSahoo-456/Placement_Prediction.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd pSahoo-456/Placement_Prediction.git`
3. Open `predict_lr.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook to view the project code and results.

### Results:
The trained model achieves great Accuarcay  on the test set, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting student placement based on IQ and CGPA.
